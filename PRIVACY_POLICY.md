# Privacy Policy for Don't Forget Schedule

Last updated: December 7, 2025

## Overview

Don't Forget Schedule is a Chrome extension that helps you stay on top of your Google Calendar events with timely notifications. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection

### What we access

- **Google Calendar Events**: We read your calendar events to display upcoming schedules and send notifications. This includes event titles, times, and locations.

### What we store locally

- **Authentication Tokens**: OAuth tokens are stored locally in your browser to maintain your signed-in session.
- **User Preferences**: Your notification timing preferences (5, 10, or 15 minutes before events) are stored locally.
- **Notification History**: A temporary record of which events have triggered notifications (cleared after 24 hours).

## Data Usage

- Your calendar data is used **only** to display events and trigger notifications.
- All data processing happens **locally** in your browser.
- We do **not** collect, transmit, or store your data on any external servers.
- We do **not** share your data with any third parties.
- We do **not** use your data for advertising or analytics.

## Third-Party Services

This extension uses **Google OAuth** to authenticate with your Google account. When you sign in, you are subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Data Security

- Authentication tokens are stored securely in Chrome's local storage.
- The extension only requests read-only access to your calendar (`calendar.readonly` scope).
- No calendar data is ever sent to external servers.

## Your Rights

You can:

- **Revoke access** at any time through your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).
- **Sign out** from the extension to clear stored authentication tokens.
- **Uninstall** the extension to remove all locally stored data.
